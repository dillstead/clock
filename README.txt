This is an implementation of a clock that reads its time from a RTC chip and converts hours, minutes, and seconds to voltage
levels that are displayed by analog voltmeters.  It's my first foray into the world of microcontrollers.

The idea is based on the Coding 101 podcast, https://twit.tv/shows/coding-101, specifically episodes 54 - 57.  Thanks guys!
